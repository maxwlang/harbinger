# Harbinger

Harbinger is a simple but flexible headless script that will monitor RSS feeds, then forward their contents to discord webhooks. I built this because I'm not interested in paying 8 dollars a month to an online service when I have the means and ability to do it myself.

## Setup

1. Configure feeds
2. Let it rip
